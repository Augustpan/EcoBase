## WorldClim
- Website: https://www.worldclim.org/
- Latest version: 2.1 (Jan 2020)
- **Historical climate data for 1970-2000**

    There are monthly climate data for minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, water vapor pressure, and for total precipitation. There are also 19 “bioclimatic” variables.

- **Future climate data for 2021-2100**

    Monthly values of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation were processed for nine global climate models (GCMs): BCC-CSM2-MR, CNRM-CM6-1, CNRM-ESM2-1, CanESM5, GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC-ES2L, MIROC6, MRI-ESM2-0, and for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs): 126, 245, 370 and 585.

    The monthly values were averages over 20 year periods (2021-2040, 241-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100). The following spatial resolutions are available (expressed as minutes of a degree of longitude and latitude): 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 2.5 minutes.

- Latest version: 7.1 (Apr 2019)
- Plant DNA C-values Database

    The DNA amount in the unreplicated gametic nucleus of an organism is referred to as its C-value, irrespective of the ploidy level of the taxon. The Plant DNA C-values Database currently contains C-value data for 12,273 species comprising 10,770 angiosperms, 421 gymnosperms, 303 pteridophytes (246 ferns and fern allies and 57 lycophytes), 334 bryophytes, and 445 algae.
